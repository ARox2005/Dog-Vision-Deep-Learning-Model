# üê∂ Dog Vision ‚Äì Dog Breed Identification with Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model to identify dog breeds from images using the **Kaggle Dog Breed Identification** dataset. The model is built with **TensorFlow** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and achieves an accuracy of **80%** on the validation set.

## üìå Overview
- Classifies over **100 dog breeds** from raw images  
- Utilizes **CNN architecture** with **transfer learning** and **data augmentation** for improved performance  
- Trained and validated using data from the [Kaggle Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification) competition

## üß† Model Features
- Preprocessing with image resizing and normalization  
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet)  
- Optimized using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer  
- Evaluation includes accuracy, loss curves, and prediction samples
